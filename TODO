Add a simple flask app to show the interface and serve up resources.
    Use Frozen-Flask to make it into a static site.
    It should consist entirely of javascript, with no python backend at all.
    Any save-games should be stored client-side.
    It's a desktop app masquerading as a browser game.
    It should be servable with any simple http server. Example: http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/
Add some javascript to track location in a map loaded from disk
    Yes, players could cheat if they wanted to.
Hook up the movement buttons to actual movement
    Rotation will probably be a pain
        "Forward" will mean "Move to the node that is in the direction that I am currently facing."
        Could ask the user if there's any ambiguity.
        Could also add a check for this when building.
            "Hey, your paths are ambiguous. They don't constrain to just NSEW."
            Nodes should be 1u in any one direction. If other directions are more than 0, it's an error.
    Also reload the viewport
Set up a .blend file and a script to do automated rendering of scenes.
    Model the scene
    Add empties for each possible player location, within the constraints of the 5ft square.
    Render the scene from each empty's position in all 4 directions. (No rotation animations.)
    Also generate the map file that the javascript loads
        It will require manual editing of what connects where
        unless we move from empties to bones, which can branch.
